Hi, I'm an AI Engineering Student

AI Engineering student building practical AI systems and service-oriented applications

Currently working on

Insurance Policy RAG QA Service (LLM · Vector DB · Evaluation) VeVillage – Plant-Based Community & Challenge App
An inclusive platform where both vegans and non-vegans participate in food, sustainability, and lifestyle challenges.

🔗 GitHub (coming soon) · Resume (in progress) · Contact (available upon request)

🚀 Featured Projects 📌 Insurance Policy RAG QA Service

PDF-based Question Answering system with citation & hallucination control

Built a RAG pipeline that retrieves policy clauses and generates answers with page-level evidence

Introduced distance-threshold-based rejection when evidence is insufficient

Focused on reproducibility through structured logging (request_id, JSONL)

Tech Stack Python · FastAPI · ChromaDB · SentenceTransformers · Ollama

🔗 Repo / API examples included

📌 VeVillage – Vegan Community & Challenge App (In Progress)

Service-oriented application for vegan challenges & community engagement

Goal Encourage sustainable vegan habits through challenges, community interaction, and motivation systems

What I’m working on

Designing challenge & community features from a user perspective

Structuring backend logic and data flow

Considering future integration of recommendation or AI-based features

Focus

Practical service design

User-centered feature planning

Expandable architecture for future AI integration

🔗 (In progress – private / prototype stage)

🛠 Skills AI / NLP

RAG architecture (retrieval → generation)

Similarity search & hallucination control

Basic evaluation & failure case analysis

Backend / Service

FastAPI & REST API design

Data flow & schema modeling

Logging, debugging, and iteration

Programming

Python

📚 Research Interests & Study Focus

I’m interested in LLM and RAG-related research, especially from an implementation perspective.

How retrieval quality affects answer reliability

Evaluation and failure cases in RAG systems

Bridging research ideas into real services

I focus on understanding how papers can be translated into working systems, rather than theory alone.
